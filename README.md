## React Routing

## Pre-reqs :

- Single Page Application.
- Client Side bundle.
- Client Side Route.


- SPA : Single page Application : `A Single Page Application is a type of web application that dynamically updates a single HTML page without requiring full page reloads. In SPAs, the initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are loaded once, and subsequent interactions (such as navigating between different views or fetching data) happen without refreshing the entire page.`

- Client Side Routing : `Client-side routing refers to managing navigation within a web application on the client side (in the browser) without making additional requests to the server. In traditional multi-page applications, each route corresponds to a separate HTML page. In contrast, client-side routing allows changing the URL and rendering different components based on the URL without reloading the entire page.`

- Client Side Bundle : `When you build a React application, it generates a bundle of JavaScript files that contain all the necessary code for your app to run. The client-side bundle refers to this compiled JavaScript bundle that gets sent to the userâ€™s browser.`

    The bundle includes:

            React components.
            Third-party libraries (if used).
            Application-specific logic.
